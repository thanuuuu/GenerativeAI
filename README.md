**Generative AI Challenge: Distinguishing Real and Fake Profile Photos**

This GitHub repository focuses on the development of a machine learning model to combat identity fraud in the digital realm. As a participant in the global competition, I have successfully completed the project and would like to share insights into my approach.

The objective of the competition was to create a model capable of accurately distinguishing between real and fake profile photos generated using advanced AI algorithms. With the prevalence of generative AI, fraudulent identities have become a significant concern for online services.

To tackle this challenge, I employed various machine learning techniques and methodologies. Initially, I analyzed the provided dataset, which consisted of a `train.csv` file for training the model and a `test.csv` file for evaluation. The target variable in the training dataset indicated whether a photo was 'real' or 'fake' (labeled as '0' and '1' respectively).

Preprocessing played a crucial role in preparing the image data for model training. As the images were represented as 20 x 20 x 3 (channels), I performed necessary transformations to normalize the pixel values and ensure consistency across the dataset.

Next, I explored different machine learning algorithms, including but not limited to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), decision trees, and ensemble methods. I trained and fine-tuned multiple models, iterating through various hyperparameters to optimize performance.

To evaluate the models, I leveraged the `test.csv` file, making predictions on unseen data. The F1 score was employed as the evaluation metric, providing insights into the model's precision and recall.

Upon achieving satisfactory results, I focused on documenting my methodology, including detailed explanations of the chosen algorithms, preprocessing techniques, and hyperparameter tuning strategies. I also highlighted the challenges faced during the project and the techniques employed to overcome them.

In this repository, you will find the complete codebase, including the necessary scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Additionally, I have provided a comprehensive README file with instructions on how to reproduce the results and deploy the trained model.

By sharing my approach and codebase, I aim to contribute to the broader machine learning community and foster discussions on effective techniques for combating identity fraud in online services.

Feel free to explore the repository and utilize the resources to enhance your understanding of this critical issue. Together, we can create more secure and trustworthy online experiences for users worldwide.

## Project Overview

This GitHub repository addresses the critical issue of identity fraud in the digital realm. As a participant in the global competition, I have successfully completed the project and would like to share insights into my approach.

## Data Visualization

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

To gain insights into the dataset and understand the potential for image classification, I performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Initially, I reduced the dimensionality of the image data to two principal components (n=2) and visualized it in a 2D plot. Subsequently, I expanded the analysis to three principal components (n=3) and plotted the results in a 3D plot.

#### 2D Visualization

The 2D plot using the first two principal components provided a preliminary understanding of the data's separability. However, it revealed limited discriminative patterns between real and fake profile photos.

#### 3D Visualization

By considering the third principal component, the 3D plot offered additional insights into the dataset's structure. Although some separation between real and fake profiles was observed, it remained insufficient for reliable image classification.

### Scree Plots

To assess the variance contained within the principal components, I generated scree plots. These plots demonstrated the diminishing amount of explained variance as we considered additional principal components. The analysis revealed that the initial 10 principal components contained insufficient information for effective image classification.

## Next Steps

Based on the limitations of PCA analysis, I recognized the need to explore alternative feature extraction techniques or consider more advanced models. Further investigations will focus on methods such as deep learning architectures, feature engineering, or leveraging pre-trained models to enhance classification performance.

Stay tuned for updates as I delve deeper into the project, explore new approaches, and work towards improving the accuracy of the identity verification model.
